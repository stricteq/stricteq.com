## What's with the name?

The Company of Griffarins was an association of journeymen printers in sixteenth-century Lyon, France, at the dawn of commercial printing trade.

Lyons was a "free labor" city, where anyone could set up shop without paying the guild a fee or presenting a masterpiece to existing masters.  However, no organization stood up for the interests of journeymen, who'd completed apprenticeships and traveling studies, often far from home, but couldn't yet afford to set up their own shops.  Under pressure from laws designed to keep them subservient---edicts even encouraged masters to use beat journeymen workers---the Griffarins began first as a secret society, then went public under cover of religious society and the local militia.  Without them, there was no printing trade, and they knew it.

Unusually literate for their time, Griffarins took pride in the value of their trade and skills for society at large.  Rather than resist labor-saving technical advancements, they embraced them, turning out more pages per day than their peers in Paris.  They also fought for good wages, the age-old tradition of communal meals at the master's table, and the equal social dignity of masters and journeymen.  Despite relatively high pay, they knew what their masters made and demanded their share of it.  When the masters mocked them as "golfarins", or "gluttons", they took the name as their own, combining with "griffon", or "griffin", to evoke sharp claws and talons, ready to fight.

The Griffarins were tradesmen, not saints, and fight they did.  Griffarins blackballed masters who refused to pay the minimum wage or took too many wageless apprentices.  They pressured "forfants", or "scabs", and not rarely with violence.  Yet they're remembered first as forerunners of modern labor organizations, a kind of proto-union centuries before the first industrial revolution.  Coming as often from nearby countries as Lyon itself, the sought community among fellow journeymen, returning reluctantly to the Catholic Church when ascendant Protestants called on them to break their oaths to each other.

The Griffarins remind us that nothing is wholly new in human experience, even the rise of a new and important technology.
