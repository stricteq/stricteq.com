To use software listed on griffarins.com to make money or for work, beyond a [free trial to make sure it works](https://griffarins.com/free#free-trials), you need to buy a license.  If you're part of a team, everyone on your team who uses the software needs to buy a license.

Otherwise, you can use and share the software for free.

Everyone's welcome to contribute fixes and improvements under a broad, free license like [the Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0).  If you'd like to become a partner in development, e-mail the developer.

The legal terms for paid licenses are at <https://griffarins.com/paid>.
