---

To use software listed on toolwrights.com to make money or for work, you need to buy a license.  If you're part of a team, everyone on your team who uses the software needs to buy a license.

Otherwise, you can use and share the software for free.  That includes [trying before you buy](https://toolwrights.com/free#free-trials), to make sure the software works and integrates well with your prototypes.

Everyone's welcome to contribute fixes and improvements under a broad, free license like [the Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0).  If you'd like to become a partner in development, e-mail the developer.

The legal terms for paid licenses are at <https://toolwrights.com/paid>.
